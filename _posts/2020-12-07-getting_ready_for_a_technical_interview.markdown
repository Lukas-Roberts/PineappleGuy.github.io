After graduating from Flatiron School, I felt confident enough in my abilities as a programmer to be successful as a software engineer, but I was worried about the interview process. I feel that while most coding bootcamps are great at teaching you the skills required for your day-to-day work life, most of them don't go into a lot of depth regarding the interview. I wanted to share some of the resources I have been using to prepare for interviews.

The main resource I have been using is a book called *Cracking the Coding Interview* by Gayle McDowell. I have been recommended this book by many people. You can buy it on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&gclid=CjwKCAiAn7L-BRBbEiwAl9UtkDBtQ9wXvMDYkmSIq_9mewStl7LKk89bkSSp3_O31htgvc9O9G4tZxoCQlsQAvD_BwE&hvadid=241896677030&hvdev=c&hvlocphy=9032519&hvnetw=g&hvqmt=b&hvrand=8452591094903148562&hvtargid=kwd-297236036583&hydadcr=16434_10305513&keywords=cracking+the+coding+interview+7th&qid=1607325362&sr=8-3&tag=googhydr-20) for $26 and I highly recommend that you do. It is a great resource. It's full of technical questions and it walks you through the interview process of several big tech companies.

Another resource that has been recommended to me more than once is [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/). LeetCode has over 1750 questions to help you "enhance your skills, expand your knowledge and prepare for technical interviews."

The final resource I have been using is called [Pramp](https://www.pramp.com/#/). Pramp is a website that allows you to do mock interviews for free. I was recommended to do 2-3 mock interviews a week, which I now recommend to you. The more you interview, the more it starts to feel like second nature. After all, practice makes perfect!

There are plenty of free resources online to help you prepare for interviews, but I feel confident I will be able to land a job with only these three. But, if anybody has a resource they think is great, I'd love to hear about it! Thank you for reading and I hope you stay safe and have a great week!
