This has been a tough week. I had an extremely hard time finding motivation to work on my Trivia app. But then I realized, today, that I am not motivated to work on it because I don't find it that interesting. So, I started thinking about what I might like to make. That's when I got the idea that I can make a Buzzfeed type quiz, which sounded fun to me.

For those of you that don't know what a Buzzfeed type quiz is, I'll explain what it is even though you have probably seen one before. It's one of those quizzes you see on social media that's title something like 'Which Disney Princess Are You?' or 'Which Character Are You From The Twilight Saga?'.

I've decided to make the quiz based on the popular Youtube group, [The Try Guys](https://www.youtube.com/c/tryguys). The Try Guys are a group of 4 that *try* things for the purpose of education and entertainment. My friend told me about them about 2 weeks ago and I have been obsessively watching their videos ever since.

Obviously, I have never made this type of thing before, but I am pretty sure I know how it works. The quizzes are multiple choice and there are no wrong answers. Each answer for each question is weighted towards a specific result. For example, a question from a Hogwarts House quiz is:

What would you not like someone to call you?
A: Selfish.
B: Ordinary.
C: Ignorant.
D: Cowardly.

Selfish would add 1 point to Hufflepuff, ordinary would add 1 point to Slytherin, ignorant would add 1 point to Ravenclaw and cowardly would add 1 point to Gryffindor.

This means I will have to decide how my answers will be weighted and make it so there will be no ties. I will also have to make a way to keep track of the score. It sounds easy enough, but I am sure that I will run into some sort of block that I wasn't expecting.
