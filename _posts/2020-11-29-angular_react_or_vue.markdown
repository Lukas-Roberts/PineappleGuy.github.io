Angular, React and Vue are Javascript frameworks used for building reactive web applications and UIs. Angular is developed by Google, React by Facebook and Vue is open-sourced and developed by a community of developers. Choosing which framework to learn/use can be stressful, all of them are great and all of them have pros and cons. I am going to talk about some of the pros and cons, which will hopefully give you a little insight to help you decide what you need/want.

Angular is basically a one stop shop. It has a ton of built in features. It has feature for sending http request, for state management, for routing and much more. The documentation is quite extensive but try not to let that overwhelm you.

React is focused more on UI-building. It doesn't have as many features as Angular, but it still has a lot to offer. The React community is exceptionally large, so when you need a feature that React doesn't have it is easy find said feature in a package. In my opinion, React is pretty easy to learn and also a lot of fun.

Vue is focused more on code writing. It falls somewhere in the middle of Angular and React when it comes to features.  it doesn't have a feature for form validation, which Angular does, but it has a feature for routing, whereas React doesn't.

Like I said before, all of these are great frameworks. But, ultimately, I recommend learning and using Angular. There are so many more features, and, in my opinion, why would you out-source when you could do everything in house. You know what I mean? Anyway, that is my take on the matter, and I hope this helps if you couldn't decide.
