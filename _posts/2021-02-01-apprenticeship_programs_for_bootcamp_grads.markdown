I found an article the other day that had a list of Apprenticeship Programs aimed at bootcamp grads and I wanted to share some of them with you. Some of them are paid programs and some of them require payment for the program, but I am only going to share some of the paid programs.

The first one is San Diego Code School. San Diego Code School is a yearlong paid apprenticeship that teaches you how to code on the job. If you apply and have no experience coding, they start you off with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Those with more experience get to choose between a bunch of courses to work through. All in all, it seems like a great program.

The next is the Microsoft Leap Program. The Microsoft Leap Program has 7 different pathways to choose from and apply for: Business Program Manager, Customer Service Engineer, Data Analyst, Software Engineer, Support Engineer, Technical Program Manager and User Experience Designer. The application process is the same for all of them. Each applicant must submit an application and 2 essays. This program seems a bit competitive, but I am sure it's worth the effort to apply.

The last one I am going to talk about is 8th Light. The article said, "8th Light is unique in that all hires come through their apprenticeship program," which I think is pretty cool. The 8th Light apprenticeship delivers a hands-on approach to learning with senior developers and live clients and projects. In order to apply, you need: an understanding of one programming language, a basic understanding of Test-Driven Development, and professional work experience that doesn't have to be in software.

There are more programs available, I just wanted to share the ones I thought looked the best. [Here](https://www.coursereport.com/blog/11-bootcamp-apprenticeship-programs) is a link to the full article if you are interested.
