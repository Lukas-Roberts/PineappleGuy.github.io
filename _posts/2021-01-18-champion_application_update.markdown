This week, I continued to work on my *League of Legends* application. I spent some time this week looking at other similar applications to get a look at some features that I could try to implement on my app. I found a couple of features that I want to add. Some of them seem a bit hard so I am going to have to do some research on how to set them up.

I am still in the process of adding the champions' information. I think it is going to take me some time because the champion pool is quite large. Each champion has four active abilities and one passive ability, and each ability has a name and a description it takes about a minute for each champion.

When I finish adding the champion information, I will have to edit my champion model and re-migrate and seed the database. After I migrate and seed the database, I will start working on the views and organizing the information in a useful way. That is all I have for an update for now. Next week I will try to include some code and maybe a screenshot if I get the views done.
