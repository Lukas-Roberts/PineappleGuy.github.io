Wow! Feels like yesterday that I was on the phone with admissions, talking over my application to Flatiron, and it feels so good to be working on the last section!

I've learned a lot from this course, from good best practices to my own personal strengths and weaknesses. Debugging was definitely my biggest weakness when I started but I feel pretty confident in debugging my code now. I learned that I usually give up just a few moments before I figure it out. I will be stuck on an issue, working on it by myself, and right when I give up and ask for help is when I figure it out. So now, whenever I want to stop and ask for help, I work on it alone for another 15 minutes.

From what I have done so far in the React section, I'd say they saved the best for last. React is so cool and, so far, its easy to use. I can't wait until I can make my own React apps. I don't want to stop doing the labs, I just want to work straight through to the end just to see how far the labs take us. 

I feel like I am nearing the end of another chapter of my life. I have made friends, stayed up way too late and woke up early to work on labs, and I've laughed, a lot, mostly at myself for making simple mistakes. I am so excited to see where completing this course is going to lead me, and the different opportunities I will encounter.
