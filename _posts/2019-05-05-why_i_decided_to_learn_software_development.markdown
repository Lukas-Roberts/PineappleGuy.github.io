     It started in high school when I was in 10th grade. I was required to take two elective classes every year, as were most, and couple of my friends decided to take an HTML class and roped me into it. I was a little nervous and didn't really know what to expect because I didn't know what programming was or how it was done.
	
     	The teacher just threw us to the wolves in the first week. She had us read through the first couple chapters as our first homework assignment. On our second day of class we started practicing and writing basic html. I loved it. Coding was so magical to me. I type a couple words and letters, maybe some numbers and then boom, my whole webpage background was bubblegum pink. My mind was blown.
			
			I didn't decide in high school that I was going to be a programmer, but I did decide in high school that coding was awesome. It wasnt until about a year ago that I decided coding was where I wanted my career to be.
