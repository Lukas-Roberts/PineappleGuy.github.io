This week, I decided to revisit one of my least favorite projects called Champion Counter Advice. When I initially had the idea to make a counter advice page, I was really excited. I love *[League of Legends](https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/)* so I thought that it would be rewarding, but when I had finished I didn't really like what I had made.

I think that, for the most part, the reason I wasn't happy with it was because it seemed basic and like there wasn't a lot of depth to it. So, I decided to add more to the project. I have already started adding the Champion's abilities and passives. It is taking a bit of time because I am adding this information manually because I didn't want to go through the process of getting access to Riot's API's. 

When I finish adding the ability information I want to work on the UI. I don't think I'm good at creating decent UI so I found a UI course on [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/desktop-guis-with-python-and-kivy/) that I am going to take that will hopefully make it easier for me. 

Another thing I want to add to the project is user accounts. With that, I want to add profiles and an about me sections where users can showcase their favorite champions and roles.

That is all I have planned for this project at the moment. I am sure that once I am done, or probably before I finish, I will have another idea that can help make it better.
