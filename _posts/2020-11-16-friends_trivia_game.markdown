I have been wanting to start a new project for a while, but I couldn't come up with an idea that made me feel inspired enough to actually do it. Then, the other day when I had a sudden urge to re-watch *Friends*, I got the idea to make *Friends* Trivia Game! I got really excited about it and started working on it right away. 

Once I began working on it, I got an even better idea. I wanted the users to be able to make their own trivia games, with the *Friends* trivia being the "base" game. I am not that far into the project yet, but there are some features I already have planned for it. 

For starters, I'm going to build it using Rails for the back-end and Javascript/React for the front-end. Once a user creates an account, they will be taken to their home page which will eventually be populated with the most popular trivia games. I want users to be able to "friend" other users and rate other users' trivia games. I also plan on adding messaging capabilities.

That is all I have planned for it so far, but I am excited to see how it grows and changes as I create it. I'm also really excited about the rating and messaging features because I have been wanting to include them in a project for a while. I will be making another blog post about it soon.
