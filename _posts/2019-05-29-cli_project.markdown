   For my CLI project I chose to scrape the Westminster Mall website, of Huntington Beach. I was a little behind from moving and didn't know what website to scrape when I found this one. It seemed like it was going to be a pretty easy project, until I dug into the html.

   I started noticing that whoever had originally coded the site was a little inconsistant with naming and location of the similar information. It definitely made scraping a bit more difficult. The mall also has 120 stores so I can understand a little of why the code is inconsistant.
