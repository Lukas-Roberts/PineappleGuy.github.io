For my JavaScript project, I made a League of Legends inspired application. It is for players to find and give countering advice, tips and tricks for Champions they have a hard time laning/playing against. Once a user submits a comment, it can be upvoted or downvoted. The comments are sorted, first by the difference in upvotes and downvotes, then by total upvotes. 

There were a lot of ups and downs with this project. I would think of a way I wanted everything to be laid out, but once I added more features it would look as good. I went through a couple of iterations on they way I displayed the champions and their counter advice.

My original thought was to display the Champions in grid and expand them to the right to display their comments. That ended up having weird effects on the layout. If a Champion was at the end of a row and was clicked it would pop down to the start of the next row leaving its space empty in the row above. So I changed it so that when you clicked on a Champion their comments would become visible in the next grid space. That also had weird effects on the layout. If the Champion was at the end of a row then it would stay their and their comments would display on the next row, which I didn't find visually appealing. I ended up having it hide all of the other champions on click and display the clicked Champion's comments. 

My favorite part of this project was setting up the upvote and downvote system. Coming up with rules for how the comments should display based on their upvotes and downvotes was fun. I am sure there is a better, more efficient way to do it but I am satisfied, for now anyway, with how I made it work. 

The hardest part for me was the planning process. I couldn't come up with an idea that I actually wanted to work on. I kept putting off working on it because I wasn't interested in my original idea. I wasted a lot of time and I learned that when it comes to personal projects, the idea needs to be something I really want to do otherwise I won't work on it.

I feel pretty good about how it works and looks, although I know it could look better. I had a lot of fun working on it once I found the right idea. I am excited to get started on the React section.
