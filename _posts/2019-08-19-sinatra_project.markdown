I did my sinatra project on a virtual cookie stand. It uses 2 models. A user model and a cookie model. A user has-many cookies and a cookie belongs-to a user. The User class has a name, username, and password. The Cookie class has a name, and cookie type.

This project was really fun to work on. I definitely learned a lot. I spent hours trying to figure out how to get some css to work. I also had a few problems with the database and git hub. They were minor problems but the stress was building so it seemed a lot worse lol. I will definitely do my best to remember to push from one computer before trying to continue on another. I also think I might take my project a little further on my freetime and make it better.
